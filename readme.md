# **Accelerating Image Classification with TensorFlow 2.0**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates how to benchmark GPU performance using a simple image classification task with a neural network in TensorFlow 2.0. The notebook covers data loading, pre-processing, model building, training, and prediction, emphasizing the speed difference between CPU and GPU training. It includes a practical exercise to explore the impact of hidden layers on performance.

# **Kindly note**
The Cuda setup is a long process and it is mandated to complete the tutorial from the following link before running the project:

## **Project Highlights**

- **Compare CPU vs. GPU Training:**  
  Discover the dramatic speed boost of GPU training. This tutorial showcases why leveraging GPUs is crucial for deep learning tasks.

- **Image Classification with ANN:**  
  We use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for image classification, providing a simplified approach compared to more complex CNNs.

- **Data Visualization & Preprocessing:**  
  Emphasizes the importance of data visualization and preprocessing steps like scaling and one-hot encoding to enhance model performance.

- **Performance Benchmarking with `timeit` Magic:**  
  Introduces the `timeit` magic command in Jupyter Notebook for efficient benchmarking, providing a clear comparison of training times.

- **Practical Exercise:**  
  Explore the impact of hidden layers on performance. See firsthand how network architecture influences training speed and accuracy.
